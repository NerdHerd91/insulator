>## Under Construction
>This repo is currently being regularly developed, when ready for production use it will be published under a new **major** release - 2.0.0. The stable version will include basic functionality and documentation for integrating into your project.

This is meant to be a very simple analysis of which javascript source files contain corresponding test files. The inspiration for this lies in the downside of Istanbul, which only supplies coverage statistics for files that contain tests. In that event it would be useful to know which source files contained no corresponding unit test files.
